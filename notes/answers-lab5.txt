Question

1. Do you have to do anything else to ensure that this I/O privilege setting is saved and restored properly when you subsequently switch from one environment to another? Why?

2. How long approximately did it take you to do this lab?

3. We simplified the file system this year with the goal of making more time for the final project. Do you feel like you gained a basic understanding of the file I/O in JOS? Feel free to suggest things we could improve.

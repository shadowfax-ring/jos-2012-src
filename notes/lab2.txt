PartI - Physical Page Management
In this part, mainly implemented physical page management code/functions. 
Allocated a PageInfo array to keep track of all available physical pages.
Each entry of PageInfo array maps to a physical page.
Moreover, implemented a page free list to keep track of free physical memory 
pages.
Guess: at this step, everything is done in memory-mapped kernel stack
